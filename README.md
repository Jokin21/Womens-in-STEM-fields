 Women in STEM Fields in Tableau

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze data on women in STEM fields, including their educational background, employment status, and career progression, in order to identify trends and patterns and gain insights into potential areas for improvement in STEM education and employment.

Dataset:
The dataset contains rows and columns, with information on [list key variables, e.g. women's educational background, employment status, job titles]. The dataset spans [time period or date range, e.g. 2015-2016], and includes data from [list sources, e.g. national surveys, industry reports].

Methodology:
The analysis will involve several steps, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: This will involve identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
Descriptive statistics: This will involve calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for key variables in the dataset.
Data visualization: This will involve creating various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots, to explore relationships between variables and identify trends and patterns.
Geographic analysis: This will involve mapping the data to identify geographic trends in women's participation in STEM fields.
Career progression analysis: This will involve analyzing the career paths of women in STEM fields to identify potential barriers to career advancement.
Expected Outcomes:
The analysis is expected to provide insights into women's participation in STEM fields, such as:

What are the most common educational backgrounds among women in STEM fields?
How do women's employment rates and salaries compare to those of men in STEM fields?
What are the most common job titles and career paths for women in STEM fields?
Are there geographic or other factors that are associated with higher rates of women's participation in STEM fields?
These insights can then be used to inform policies and practices to promote women's participation in STEM fields, such as:

Developing targeted educational programs to encourage women to pursue STEM careers.
Implementing policies to reduce gender bias in STEM hiring and promotion.
Promoting work-life balance and other policies that support women's career advancement in STEM fields.
Deliverables:
The deliverables for this project will include:

A report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including key insights and recommendations for future policies and practices.
Visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to support the findings in the report.
Cleaned and preprocessed data that can be used for further analysis or modeling.
A Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore the data and interact with the visualizations.
